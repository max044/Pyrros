# Pyrros üî•

**Pyrros** is an open-source collection of ready-to-use training scripts and techniques for large language models (LLMs), built with efficiency, modularity, and clarity in mind.

It combines:
- üß† Research-grade training methods (SFT, DPO, PPO, GRPO‚Ä¶)
- ‚ö° Memory-optimized execution (QLoRA, gradient checkpointing, Triton)
- üß© A clean, Composer-powered structure you can hack or extend
- üñ•Ô∏è Easy multi-GPU support, Lightning-style

## üöÄ Goals

- Make training LLMs accessible, reproducible, and fast.
- Provide production-ready and research-friendly codebases.
- Stay clean, no magic, no overengineering.

## üì¶ Status

> The project is under early development. First training scripts for Qwen + GRPO + QLoRA coming soon.
